In this post I will present a basic generic model to visualise the relative impact of different factors in the excess of resources required for the completion of a given group of activities.

The objective is to set the basement for the posterior development of prediction models. The final target is to discover the underlying rules of interactions and compounding between the factors considered in the model.

You will find a theoretical summary of the model developed, some explanatory graphics, and the link to the `jupyter notebook` file showing an example of possible results
